price (double). SN indicates the serial number of the computer.
For this part, you are required to design and implement the Computer class according to the
following specifications:
- Upon the creation of a computer object, the object must immediately be initialized with
valid values; that is brand, model, SN and price. (Hint: Constructors.)
- The design should allow enough flexibility so that the value of any of these attributes can
be modified later on. For example, it should be possible to create a computer object with a
given price then change its price later on. The design should also allow the user to
obtain the value of any of the attributes. (Hint: Accessors & Mutators.)
- The design should allow all information of an object to be displayed at once, through the
utilization of System.out.print() method. (Hint: toString() method)
- It is required to know how many Computer objects have been created. For that, you need
to add a method, called findNumberOfCreatedComputers(), to the class. This method
must return the number of created Computer objects prior to the time this method is
called. The method would simply return 0 if no computers have been created by the time
the method is called. (Hint: You are allowed to add other attributes to the class.)
- It is required to compare two Computer objects for equality. Two Computer objects are
considered equal if they have the same brand, model and price. (Hint: equals() method)">
